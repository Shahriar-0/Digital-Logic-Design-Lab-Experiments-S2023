## 1: Clock and Periodic Signal Generation
The goal of this experiment is to introduce the concepts of static characteristics of digital logic
gates, delay times, clock frequency generation and digital system using schematic diagram and
Verilog HDL.

## 2: Sequential Synthesis and FPGA Programming
The first goal of this experiment is to introduce the concepts of state machines that are mostly used for controllers. The second goal is to get familiar with FPGA devices and implementation.

---

## 3: Function Generator
The goal of this experiment is to design an Arbitrary Generator that is capable of generating a wide variety of waveforms with different amplitude and frequency. Among them are sine, square, rhomboid, saw-tooth and any arbitrary waveform.

## 4: Accelerator and Wrappers
The goal of this experiment is to get familiar with concepts of SoC and Accelerator and how we can use them to reduce the CPU time.
